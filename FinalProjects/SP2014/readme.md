Final Projects from Spring 2014
===============================

There were six (6) student groups in the Spring 2014 edition of this course. Five (5) of these groups were paired with student groups from the Crisis Informatics class in the College of Information Science and Technology. Crisis Informatics groups acted as the clients for the Geog 461W groups, providing a topic, data, and audience for the Geog 461W students to make a map-based application for. Below is some information about these groups and their projects.

The sixth group was involved in a project related to research done by Rachel Isaacs, a PhD Candidate in the Department of Geography. We are currently working with the sponsors of this research to ensure that the source code for the page can be released.
