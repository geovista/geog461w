Geography 461W: Dynamic Cartographic Representation
===================================================

Geography 461W (GEOG 461W) is a writing intensive, capstone course taught by Dr Alan M MacEachren in the spring semester at Penn State's University Park Campus. This course covers topics including geovisualization, geovisual analtyics, geocollaboration, use and usability, and more. 

During the course of the semester, students are introduced to the tools and techniques used to create interactive web maps in a once-per-week, 55 minute lab session. Near the middle of the term, students form groups and begin work on a final project: creating an interactive web map for a hypothetical, or real, client. This repository contains the lab materials and demonstrations used in the course, as well as the code from the final projects.
